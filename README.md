# Web-Dev-Journey
This contains my small projects and big projects regarding web development. My capstone projects will be there in a separate repository, be sure to check that in my profile.
The projects may be related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. 

1. Movie Recommendations:
   The very first project contains a simple webpage on my movie recommendations. It has been coded using HTML.
2. Birthday Party Invite:
   This is another webpage designed using HTML. It acts as a birthday party invite, incorporating hyperlinks to Google Maps location and an image with alt text for blind users. 
3. index.html:
   This is the first website I created with multiple webpages linked via hypertext and images. It is a small project on my portfolio.
4. Colour Vocab:
   This is my first project using both HTML and CSS to make colourful flashcards for the associated colours written in Spanish.
5. Web Design Agency Project:
   The project designs a very simple home-webpage for a web-design agency.
6. Flag of Laos Project:
   Using CSS to create the flag of Laos. A simple exercise to learn CSS designing.
