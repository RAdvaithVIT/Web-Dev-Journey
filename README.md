# Web-Dev-Journey
This contains my small projects and big projects regarding web development.
The projects may be related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. 

1. Movie Recommendations:
   The very first project contains a simple webpage on my movie recommendations. It has been coded using HTML.
2. Birthday Party Invite:
   This is another webpage designed using HTML. It acts as a birthday party invite, incorporating hyperlinks to Google Maps location and an image with alt text for blind users. 
3. index.html:
This is the first website I created with multiple webpages linked via hypertext and images. It is a small project on my portfolio.
4. Colour Vocab:
This is my first project using both HTML and CSS to make colourful flashcards for the associated colours written in Spanish.
