<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello all to those who are reading this!!!
  My name is R. Advaith, and I am currently pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering (student) at VIT University, Chennai Campus, with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
   Machine Learning (ML), Web Development, Block Chain, Robotics and Automation, PCB designing along with core electronics. 
   My expected year of graduation is 2027. I am a crazy cinephile and I love to direct and act theatre plays or films etc. 
   As a result I have experience in video editing as well. I also used to be a state level cricketer during my years of schooling.
