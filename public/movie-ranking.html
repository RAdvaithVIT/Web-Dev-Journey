<h1>Three Movie Recommendations by Advaith</h1>
<h2>Three Personal Favourite Movies of Mine That Are Instant Recommendations</h2>
<hr/>
<p>It is really difficult to shortlist my most favourite movies of all time, so instead I will recommend some favourites
    of mine, that might be obscured gems to many of you due to several reasons.
</p>
<h3>Gangs Of Wasseypur: Pts 1 and 2</h3>
<p>This is a fabled gangster movie in the Hindi Cinema Industry and is one of Martin Scorsese's personal favourites.
    It is a 5 hour crime saga full of great violence and entertainment.
</p>
<h3>High and Low</h3>
<p>This is not necessarily obscured, but it might be for people who are not familiar with the Japanese film industry and the GOAT
    director, Akira Kurosawa. Despite the fact that some of his other movies are more critically acclaimed, this film remains
    my personal favourite movie of his.
</p>
<h3>Barry Lyndon</h3>
<p>This is probably Kubrick's most underappreciated masterpiece. If the stills from this movie feel boring and makes you want to
    procrastinate its viewing, you might consider to stop doing that and watch it a.s.a.p.
